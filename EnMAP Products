Level 2A Processor (Atmospheric Correction
Water) ATBD

The algorithm (i.e. o algoritimo que converte imagens L1C em L2A Atmospheric Correction Water - in the moment of ordering the data, the user can choose between land/water applications) converts the top-of-atmosphere radiances (level L1B or L1C) 
into underwater reflectances in the visible spectral interval. 

Underwater reflectances simply are the ratios of upward to downward fluxes right beneath the water surface. 

Normalized water reflectance is Upwelling Radiance divided by downwelling irradiance times pi for both nadir sun and nadir view angles.

The L1B data can be processed before orthorectification and in this case VNIR and SWIR data must be co-registered to the VNIR spectrometer. //// EnPT should do this

Orthorectified data (L1C) can also be processed and, in this case, the nearest neighbor method should be applied for image resampling.    //// this as well

Results of L2A Land processor (e.g. cloud mask and preliminary water mask) are also used as input to the L2A (water) processor.
