„Atmospheric transmittance and absorption correction and sensor calibration
of hyperspectral imagery are more difficult than they are for multispectral
imagery because of hyperspectral imagery’s substantially higher spectral
resolution. The specific reasons for this extra difficulty include the following:
• Hyperspectral sensor bands coinciding with narrow atmospheric
absorption features or the edges of broader spectral features will be
affected by the atmosphere differently than the neighboring bands
• The band locations in imaging spectrometer systems are prone to small
wavelength shifts under different operating conditions, particularly in
airborne sensors
• Many analysis algorithms for hyperspectral data require precise
absorption band-depth measurements exactly at the wavelength of
maximum absorption
• From the computational standpoint alone, the calibration problem is much
greater for hyperspectral systems.” Schowengerdt (2007)
